                        <p>Symptoms of ozone injury develop on the leaves of sensitive plant species during the growing season if ozone concentrations are relatively high for extended periods of time. Ozone injury is cumulative, so symptoms become more severe the longer leaves are exposed to high ozone concentrations. Therefore, symptoms of injury are typically worse in the late summer and early fall. This example will illustrate ozone injury on a sensitive variety of the snap bean plant, but keep in mind that ozone injury can look slightly different on other types of plants. Next, you will learn the specific characteristics that distinguish ozone damage from damage caused by insects, diseases, and other environmental factors.</p>

                                <img src="/Images/stippleExample.png" alt="Examples of stipples" class="img-fluid">
                                <p> Visible ozone injury on leaves starts as stipple. Stipples only occur on the top leaf surface and are dot-like areas of tan, red, brown, purple, or black. They are typically separate and uniform in size, but may eventually merge and cover much of the leaf surface as ozone exposure continues. Stipples may look slightly different on other types of plants. [In photo below, brown spots are stipples, white areas are other types of damage]<p/>

                                <h5>Looking for green leaf veins</h5>
                                <p>Ozone damage only occurs between the major leaf veins, not on the veins themselves. If you see damage on or crossing leaf veins, it is not caused by ozone. In ozone-damaged leaves, the veins often stand out as bright green compared to the darker damaged patches.</p>

                                <h5>Yellow and brown patches</h5>

                                <p>As ozone injury accumulates and becomes more severe, additional symptoms may occur. These include leaf yellowing (chlorosis) or brown patches of tissue death (necrosis). These symptoms will be visible on the top leaf surface, and may start to become visible on the back of the leaf.</p>

                        <h5>Older leaves have more damage</h5>
                        <p>Because ozone injury accumulates, signs of injury will typically develop on the older leaves of the plant. You might see some newer leaves that are bright green with no injury at the same time you see older leaves with injury.</p>

                        <h5>Natural senescence</h5>
                        <p>In the fall, plants start to shut down for the winter (senesce) and will drop their leaves. It can be very difficult to distinguish ozone damage from natural senescence during this time. </p>

                        <h5>Other types of injury</h5>
                        <p>Symptoms of disease, insect activity, and environmental factors like nutrient deficiency or drought stress can look very similar to ozone damage. It takes some practice to recognize ozone injury on plants, but with careful observation of the specific symptoms you can learn to accurately diagnose this injury. Keep in mind that symptoms of disease, insect activity, and environmental stress are also likely to be present on the ozone-sensitive plants, even at the same time as ozone injury. </p>
